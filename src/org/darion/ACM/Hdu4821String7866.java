 * <p>
 * Given a string S and two integers L and M,
 * we consider a substring of S as “recoverable” if and only if
 * (i) It is of length M*L;
 * (ii) It can be constructed by concatenating M “diversified” substrings of S, where each of these substrings has length L; two strings are considered as “diversified” if they don’t have the same character for every position.
 * <p>
 * Two substrings of S are considered as “different” if they are cut from different part of S. For example, string "aa" has 3 different substrings "aa", "a" and "a".
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Your task is to calculate the number of different “recoverable” substrings of S.
